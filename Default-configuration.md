[This](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/blob/master/smartparens-config.el) is current default configuration of smartparens. The `M-x customize-group smartparens` settings are not listed there, as they can be easily viewed with the aforementioned command. For an example of additional configuration you can check [[example configuration]] of the author.

To load the default configuration, use:

```scheme
(require 'smartparens-config)
```

This will automatically load `smartparens` too. If you do not wish to use the default configuration, you can simply `(require 'smartparens)` or let it load by autoload facility.

The default configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/blob/master/smartparens-config.el).
