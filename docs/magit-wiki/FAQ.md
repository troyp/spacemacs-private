## FAQ

The list of frequently asked questions has been integrated into the
manual.  The manual is also available online - the page with FAQ
can be found [here](https://magit.vc/manual/magit/FAQ.html).

At times you will find a list of frequently *and recently* asked
questions below.  These questions are either only relevant for a short
period of time and therefore won't be added to the manual or they just
haven't been added to the manual yet.
