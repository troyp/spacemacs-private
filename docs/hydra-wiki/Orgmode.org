* Global Orgmode Bindings
Timers, work clocking, and capturing from anywhere (I use this hydra multiple times each hour).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 (defhydra hydra-global-org (:color blue)
   "Org"
   ("t" org-timer-start "Start Timer")
   ("s" org-timer-stop "Stop Timer")
   ("r" org-timer-set-timer "Set Timer") ; This one requires you be in an orgmode doc, as it sets the timer for the header
   ("p" org-timer "Print Timer") ; output timer value to buffer
   ("w" (org-clock-in '(4)) "Clock-In") ; used with (org-clock-persistence-insinuate) (setq org-clock-persist t)
   ("o" org-clock-out "Clock-Out") ; you might also want (setq org-log-note-clock-out t)
   ("j" org-clock-goto "Clock Goto") ; global visit the clocked task
   ("c" org-capture "Capture") ; Don't forget to define the captures you want http://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html
   ("l" org-capture-goto-last-stored "Last Capture"))
