## Using the functions generated by `defhydra`

If you define a simple hydra like this:

```
(defhydra hydra-zoom (global-map "<f2>")
  "zoom"
  ("g" text-scale-increase "in")
  ("l" text-scale-decrease "out"))
```

You can bind it to a key chord like this:

```cl
(key-chord-define-global "tt" 'hydra-zoom/body)
```

In fact, since `defhydra` returns the body symbol, you can even write it like this:

```cl
(key-chord-define-global
 "tt"
 (defhydra hydra-zoom (global-map "<f2>")
  "zoom"
  ("g" text-scale-increase "in")
  ("l" text-scale-decrease "out")))
```

If you like key chords so much that you don't want to touch the global map at all, you can e.g.:

```
(key-chord-define-global
 "hh"
 (defhydra hydra-error ()
   "goto-error"
   ("h" first-error "first")
   ("j" next-error "next")
   ("k" previous-error "prev")))
```

You can also substitute `global-map` with any other keymap, like `c++-mode-map` or
`yas-minor-mode-map`.
