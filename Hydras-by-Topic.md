This page aggregates the links to other wiki pages which suggest hydras. Feel free to add your own or extend others. Hydras will be very rich and you should still edit them to your liking. So uncomment heads that you don't find useful or change the keys etc..

You can also explore many hydras [with a github code search](https://github.com/search?q=defhydra++extension%3Ael+-filename%3Ahydra&type=Code&utf8=âœ“).
