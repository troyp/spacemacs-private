Japanese users can use [[https://github.com/emacs-jp/migemo][migemo]], an Emacs package that provides Japanese increment search with 'Romanization of Japanese'(ローマ字).

** Configuration
First, install [[https://github.com/emacs-jp/migemo][migemo]] and configure it properly. Then enable ~helm-migemo-mode~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(helm-migemo-mode t)
#+END_SRC

** Usage
~helm-migemo-mode~ activates =migemo= support for the following:

- Bookmarks (including filtered)
- Buffers
- Files in current directory
- File name history
  - =C-c h= in ~helm-find-files~
- ~helm-find-files~ 
  - Single space after a current path is needed to get candidates via =migemo=.
- Kill ring
- Minibuffer history
- =(m)occur=
- =recentf=

To enable =migemo= in your code, use the ~migemo~ slot in your classes or with the diverse build functions for sources (~helm-build-sync-source~, etc.). Only "sync" and "in-buffer" sources suppport =migemo=.

*** helm-migemo.el
You will find in a package called =helm-migemo.el= in [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]]. *This package is deprecated and not supported by helm, so please do not use it!*
