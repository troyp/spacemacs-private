;; This file provides a single command `sort-group-lines' for sorting lines into
;; groups matching regular expressions.
;; 
;;;;

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `sort-group-lines'
;;    Group lines between positions BEG and END according to which regexp in REGEXPS they match.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put sort-group-lines.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'sort-group-lines)


;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defun sort-group-lines (reverse beg end regexps)
  "Group lines between positions BEG and END according to which regexp in REGEXPS they match.
The groups are then placed in the same order as in REGEXPS; top first if REVERSE is nil, or bottom first if non-nil.
 When called interactively the regexp's are prompted for until a blank is entered, BEG and END are defined by the currently
 active region, and REVERSE is set to t if a prefix arg is passed but nil otherwise."
  (interactive (list current-prefix-arg (region-beginning) (region-end) nil))
  (let ((n 0) (regexp t) (intp (interactive-p)))
